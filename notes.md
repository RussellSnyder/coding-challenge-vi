## Issues setting up

```
# 3. Setup default lit-stories
# ℹ️ Seniors: Only needed if you selected `lit-ts` as template
rm -rf ./src/stories
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtualidentityag/vi-frontend-hub/main/src/applicant/assets/main-element.stories.ts -o ./src/my-element.stories.ts
```

This did not work. I was going to use the lit template, but decided for react because this did not work. 

## Some lanuage notes

"For CSS try to use as less classes as possible and avoid CSS frameworks."

For CSS styling, please try to use the least amount of classes possible and avoid using CSS frameworks.
